The CSS property `content` is used with the `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements to insert generated content.  However, if the `content` property is not set, or set to `none`, no content will be generated.  A common mistake is expecting content to be generated by default, leading to unexpected behavior.  The same applies to pseudo-elements such as `::first-line`, `::first-letter`, and `::selection`, each requiring explicit content definition.
