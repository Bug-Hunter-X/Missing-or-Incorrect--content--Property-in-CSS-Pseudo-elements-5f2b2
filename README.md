# Missing or Incorrect 'content' Property in CSS Pseudo-elements

This repository demonstrates a common CSS bug related to the use of the `content` property with pseudo-elements like `::before` and `::after`.  The issue arises when developers incorrectly assume that content is generated by default, leading to unexpected behavior.

The `bug.css` file showcases the problem. The `bugSolution.css` file provides the correct implementation.

## Bug Description:

When using pseudo-elements (`::before`, `::after`, etc.), you must explicitly set the `content` property to define the content to be generated.  If you omit this property or set it to `none`, no content will be generated, which can result in unexpected styling issues or a lack of visual elements.

## Solution:

Always explicitly set the `content` property with the desired text or generated content for pseudo-elements.  This ensures the expected behavior.

## Usage:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.html` in a web browser to observe the initial incorrect behavior.
3. Open `bugSolution.html` to see the correct implementation.

This example highlights the importance of correctly using the `content` property when working with CSS pseudo-elements to prevent unexpected issues.
